                    <p>
                        "I got to London a little late (thanks, Houston airport), got my Oyster card, navigated to our Airbnb, 
                        and had a victor's dinner of plums and beer from a Michelin star-rated Tesco. Went on an unofficial
                        'Sherlock' tour of London, visiting the original 221B Baker Street, sets from the show, and Sherlock 
                        themed pub for our first London pint. Having had a freak book-selling event leave me temporarily crippled 
                        for my first few days in London meant I had trouble tooling around but we did get around to hitting all the 
                        famous, seen-on-tv highlights including the London Eye, Very Large Ben, Parliament, Victoria Gardens, etc."

                        "We washed up in Paris your basic tired, poor, huddled Americans yearning to eat cheese. Welcome to the land 
                        where fresh baked bread is plentiful, literally everything you see is postcard-worthy, and sunsets are stunning. 
                        We were completely restored after a good afternoon's nap, a phenomenal duck confit dinner, and a stroll down some 
                        of Paris' ancient streets late into the evening. Paris is designed to make you feel like being an existentialist 
                        and chilling in smoky cafes wearing black and white striped shirts is the only way to live."

                        of the city in an idyllic little town called Leiden. We canooed through Leiden's canals, walked it's streets
                        late at night, and happened upon a little bit of St. Louis abroad: an international campus for Webster
                        University."

                        "Let me just start by saying 'ITALY IS THE WORST'. You heard me. We landed in Venice and hightailed it to a fancy hotel for 
                        the glamous part of the trip. No Airbnb's for these guys. We hightailed it to the other end of the city to a beautiful
                        hotel on the beach. We toured three islands of Venice's coast, all famous for various things - Murano is a handblown glass
                        lovers paradise, Burano is famous for residents making delicate lace for hundreds of years, and Torcello has no bathrooms.
                        On the entire island. We decided to move into the city for the last night of our stay and book a hostel. Armed with only a photo
                        of the Google Maps&copy directions, we were lost and spend hours looking for the right alley. No one in the entire city spoke English or
                        understood frantic hand gestures. We gave up and decided to lay down and let the canals have us. I mean, the water level is rising in Venice. 
                        It would reach us eventually. Just then, when all hope was lost and night was settling in, we hear a woman walking past speaking in a 
                        British accent. We run her down, ask for directions, and finally set out on our way. She gave us terrible directions but just the bit 
                        of hope we needed to renew our search. We did eventually find the hostel. While we were out and about, we asked people we encountered for 
                        their recommendations. What do the kids do in the evenings? We were told by many people about a storied discoteque, "you've just got to go there." So, we get all dolled up and head out in the dead of night
                        to find this magical club. We criss-cross this relatively small city looking for it only to find that it had closed some years ago. 
                        We give up and spend the night at a little wine bar in a quiet alley and see a wedding party walk by. Eventually, we go back to our 
                        hostel and unsuccessfully try to learn the dance from "Something Borrowed" and go to sleep."
